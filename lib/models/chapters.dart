      This is not for you if you do not enjoy erotica. Everything in this narrative is fictional. The locations described inside are purely fictitious. It is not incest or a family stroke, so read carefully. \n

      There is a happy ending in this story, and there is no cheating.

      I am not going to publish a special chapter if I complete this. Let the ending be whatever the story's ending is. Comment to express your appreciation for this story! You can add me on Facebook to find out when the next update is, plus there are some teases for the following chapters.

      Thank you very much, dear readers!

      Publish chapter will be 10 chapters lang po. Ang kwento po na ito ay magiging libro sa halagang 299 pesos at magkakaroon ng free chapter sa dulo. Mag-comment na lamang sa mga gustong magpa-reserve sa halagang 160 pesos. Limited lamang po ang librong ito at per-batch lang din po.
